# Python-Reinforcement-Learning-AI-test
A project I did in 2020 as part of my University Course.

This is the project I created as part of my university course. 
This forms the basis of an attempt I had at creating a program utilising some kind of learning algorithmn in a simple environment. 
Although I will not provide the full written documentation as submitted to my University, I will include parts that are relevant to the design.

NOTE: The documentation was written for the 0.1.1 Version, and as such code might look slightly different, although functionality should remain the same.
